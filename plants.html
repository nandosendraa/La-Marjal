                <p>Decoction with pieces of the tender part of the reed (when pulling out a stem, the lower white part is tender 
                    and can be consumed raw). We will put nine tender pieces in half a liter of water, which we will boil for 3 
                    minutes. of the resulting liquid (water from reeds) we will drink 100 ml. fasting for 9 days in a row (a ninth).
                     as hypotensive.
                    Decoction; We put a liter of water in a container, to which we add 30 grams of pieces of the fresh plant, 
                    and we put it to boil for 10 minutes, and then rest for 20 minutes. We filter the liquid, add 100 grams of 
                    honey and store it in a bottle. With this warm syrup, not cold, we will gargle three times a day for two minutes, 
                    for several days. This treatment is excellent as well as harmless against inflammation and irritation of the throat,
                     caused by the inhalation of gases and smoke, including tobacco.
                    Decoction; We put two tablespoons of pieces of the aerial plant in half a liter of water, which we will boil for
                     3 minutes. The liquid, already cold, will be used as a lotion, and with it we will massage the scalp for seven 
                     days to prevent hair loss.
                    There is a popular belief to make warts disappear. To do this we must pull out a stem and wet the wart with the 
                    juice of the most tender part of the bottom of the stem, and then insert the stem into the same hole where 
                    we have pulled it out. As they say, the stem dries up and the wart disappears.</p>

                    nus. From each gemma so much pot to sort out a new rhizome with a canya.
                    The main stem of the grasses s'anomena canya. The canya is a fibrous trunk, balmat and regularly separated 
                    from both rigid membranes that coincide with nusos. The canyes do not have escorça; The outer part is
                     smooth, very hard, and the internal part is very flexible.
