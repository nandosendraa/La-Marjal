                <p>It is an unmistakable species in its environment. It is a medium-sized flail, measuring between 30 and 38 cm and has a wingspan of 50 to 62 cm. Its weight can vary between 192 and 500 g.3 4 The general coloration of its plumage is blackish gray, with the head and neck darker, except for the area under the tail which is white, and also white stripes that cross transversely its flanks. Its beak is red, like the face shield, except for the tip which is yellow. Its facial shield is rounded at the top while its sides are straight and quite parallel, comparing it with the frontal shield of the American redfish that narrows more when it meets the bill and has a straighter upper part. Its legs are greenish-yellow, with a red spot on the knees. They have very long toes lacking the lobes of the coots and any webbing, adapted to walk on aquatic vegetation. Juveniles are brownish in color and lack a red face shield.</p>

                <p>The ardeidae (Ardeidae) are a family of Pelecaniform birds that includes more than sixty species, known generically as herons throughout the Hispanic world. The ardeids were previously classified within the order of the ciconiiformes. They are wading birds, and some species can measure up to 85 cm tall. Generally its plumage is white, its beak yellow and its long gray legs, although the plumage varies according to the season of the year. They feed on fish, crustaceans and small amphibians, and their habitat is swampy areas or near lakes around the world. They are generally solitary, but it is normal to see them gathered in community in the breeding season. They nest in tall trees, where they make rough nests, practically flat, and lay up to six eggs. They are distributed worldwide and are among the most abundant continental birds in the world, second only to passerines. Herons are important in the control of invasive species such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</p>
