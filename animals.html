                        It is an unmistakable species in its environment. It is a medium-sized flail, measuring between 30
                    and 38 cm and has a wingspan of 50 to 62 cm. Its weight can vary between 192 and 500 g.3 4 The
                    general coloration of its plumage is blackish gray, with the head and neck darker, except for the
                    area under the tail which is white, and also white stripes that cross transversely its flanks. Its
                    beak is red, like the face shield, except for the tip which is yellow. Its facial shield is rounded
                    at the top while its sides are straight and quite parallel, comparing it with the frontal shield of
                    the American redfish that narrows more when it meets the bill and has a straighter upper part. Its
                    legs are greenish-yellow, with a red spot on the knees. They have very long toes lacking the lobes
                    of the coots and any webbing, adapted to walk on aquatic vegetation. Juveniles are brownish in color
                    and lack a red face shield.
                    The common moorhen is the type species of the genus Gallinula, which belongs to the Rallidae family,
                     a family of aquatic and semi-aquatic birds of medium size, although small compared to the rest of the Gruiformes. 
                     Rails typically have relatively long necks, short tails, stout legs with long toes, and inconspicuous 
                     plumage in contrast to their colorful bills and front shields.

                        The osprey (Pandion haliaetus), also known as halieto, guincho or fisherman's hawk, is a species of
                    accipitriform bird of the Pandionidae family. It is a medium-sized raptor that appears on all
                    continents, except Antarctica, although in South America it is only a non-nesting migrant. Some
                    classifications place it as the only member of the genus Pandion, while others consider a second
                    species within this genus, Pandion cristatus.
                    The osprey was one of many species described by Charles Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema 
                    naturæ, and named Falco haliætus. The genus Pandion, the only member of the family Pandionidae, 
                    was described by the French zoologist Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809 and takes the name of 
                    the mythical Greek king, Pandion.6910
                    The osprey differs in several respects from other diurnal birds of prey. The toes are of equal 
                    length, their tarsi are reticulated and their claws are rounded. Ospreys and owls are the only 
                    birds of prey whose outer toes are reversible, allowing them to grasp prey with two toes in front
                     and two toes behind. This is particularly useful when catching slippery fish

                        The ardeidae (Ardeidae) are a family of Pelecaniform birds that includes more than sixty species,
                    known generically as herons throughout the Hispanic world. The ardeids were previously classified
                    within the order of the ciconiiformes. They are wading birds, and some species can measure up to 85
                    cm tall. Generally its plumage is white, its beak yellow and its long gray legs, although the
                    plumage varies according to the season of the year. They feed on fish, crustaceans and small
                    amphibians, and their habitat is swampy areas or near lakes around the world. They are generally
                    solitary, but it is normal to see them gathered in community in the breeding season. They nest in
                    tall trees, where they make rough nests, practically flat, and lay up to six eggs. They are
                    distributed worldwide and are among the most abundant continental birds in the world, second only to
                    passerines. Herons are important in the control of invasive species such as rainbow trout
                    (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
