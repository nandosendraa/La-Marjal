                        The samarugo (Valencia hispanica) or samaruc (in Valencian) is an actinopterygian, euryhaline fish,
                    native to the still waters and streams of the coastal area of ​​the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of
                    the three species of cyprinodontiformes that are endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, along with the
                    fartet (Aphanius iberus) and the salinete (Aphanius baeticus).

                    Another similar species, the funnel (Fundulus heteroclitus), was initially described in the Bay of
                    Cádiz as Valencia lozanoi and was considered autochthonous to the Iberian Peninsula until its North
                    American origin was verified.

                    The samarugo is included in a group of fish, known colloquially as killies (Cyprinodontiformes
                    oviparos), a group that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the globe
                    except for Oceania and Northeast Asia.

                        The mullet (or múgil, mugle, llisa, muble lisa, liza, albur, cabezudo, capitón, corcón or pardete)
                    [citation needed] (Mugil cephalus) is a species of euryhaline fish of the mugílidae family.
                    They have two dorsal fins, the first with only four spiny rays, separated from the rear with only 
                    soft rays: the pelvic fins are subabdominal, with a spine; when they have a lateral line, it is very 
                    visible; the mouth is of moderate size, without teeth or with very small ones.
                    They gather in schools. They feed on fine algae, diatoms and detritus from the bottom sediments.
                    [citation needed] They are not of great commercial importance. They can be fished from boats, 
                    artisanally with harpoons, or with rods from the coast.

                        The llobarro, the llobina, the llop, llop de mar, llobató, [2] mollet, (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a
                    species of peix blanc osteïcti from the family of the morònids i molt corrent a les costs dels
                    Països Catalans. [3] The youthful form is called pintat. [
                    The Romans considered it one of the noblest fish.
                    It is curious that, until very recently, our kitchen had not given it the importance it deserves. 
                    Currently, sea bass is being lavished, being an obligatory dish in any self-respecting Basque 
                    restaurant. Surely it was Pedro Subijana, with his splendid sea bass with green pepper, who erased 
                    his fish label for sick people, back in 1977 and 78. And his white and firm meat began to be treated 
                    with new flavors: saffron, fennel, green pepper , thyme, calvados, algae, sage, mint, txakoli, 
                    tarragon...
                    Internationally renowned is cooking en papillote, a preparation that was invented by the cook of 
                    Pope Leo III (s. VIII) and was served at the coronation of Emperor Charles the Great. In more recent 
                    times, one of the great versions of Paul Bocusse was the puff pastry sea bass. It also exudes taste 
                    roasted whole or in honor loins, with oil and aromatic herbs.
